    PV cells, or solar panels, use sunlight to generate electricity. They help us save money on electricity bills, reduce pollution, and provide power in remote areas. While they can be expensive to install and don't work at night, they are a vital part of our move towards cleaner, renewable energy. Using solar panels, we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and help protect the environment for future generations. They're an important tool in creating a sustainable and green energy future.
