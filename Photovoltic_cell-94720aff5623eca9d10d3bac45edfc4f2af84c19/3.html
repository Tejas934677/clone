<hr><h1>Working</h1><ul><li>When the light radiation falls on the P-n junction diode , electrons-hole pairs are generated by the absorbtion of the radiation  </li>
    <li>The electrons are drifted and collected at n-type end and the holes are drifted and collected at the p-type end </li>
    <li>When these two ends are electrically connected through a conductor , there is a flow of current b/w  two ends through the external circuit .</li></ul> <br> 
    
    Thus Photoeletric current is produced and available for use
